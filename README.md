# Cura-initial-travel-speed-modifier
This python code allows users to alter the initial travel speed of the 3d printer in Cura.
The feature is useful when you want to print the first layer travel speed slow but you do not want the extruder moving too slowly from end position of the start g code to the first printing line's start position.
